# keyboard_command
Takes in keyboard inputs and runs commands instead of writing keys. This is recommended for secondary keyboards. It turns them into macro pads.

In order to get this to run at login (at least on gnome 43 or whatever I'm running)
1. Download python, bash, and desktop files
2. Place the python and bash files wherever you want, modify bash file accordingly
3. Modify the python file, instructions are inside, this may take some technical knowledge and experimentation, unless you happen to have the exact same setup, needs, and workflow that I have (unlikely)
5. Place the .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart, modify it accordingly
6. Now your program should run at start, and you can use your (secondary) keyboard as a macro pad!!!


If you have tips or suggestions please tell me, and if you modify the script, please upload it to this repository if possible, idk how github works

NOTE: in order for the script to work, I think open-razer and polychromatic have to be installed
